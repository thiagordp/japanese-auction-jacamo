# Japanese Auction with MAS


Project sumitted to MultiAgent Systems subject in PGEAS/UFSC.

Using the JaCaMo framework for agent based systems development, we have implemented a simulation of a Japanese Auction.

## How the japanese auction works

A initial small price for an item is set and the auction starts.
All the agents interested on that item enter the auction.
Interactively, the auctioner will increase the price in one unit.
Each buyer will stay in the auction while the current price in less or equal then its own budget.
The auction ends when only one buyers is left.
